Blog Platform API

This project is a blog platform RESTful API built using the Spring framework and Spring Boot. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts.

Prereq's: Command line knowhow or at least an IDE to be able to load this project.

How to run and test:

1. Load project into IDE, or direct your CLI to the project's location/root folder.
2. Run the program in the IDE or have the CLI run "mvn clean install" once successful, run "mvn spring-boot:run"
3. Open up your web browser and enter 'http://localhost:8080/posts'
4. You'll now see the interface where you'll see posts on the bottom (There will be none from the initial start, you'll have to make a post to see one), and the section to create/save posts up top.
5. Once you create a post, you'll see the option to view, edit, and delete each individual post. Happy posting!
